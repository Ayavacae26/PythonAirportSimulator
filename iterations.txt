Iteration tasks for python project
10/22/18

Below is list of parts for this project.

Main components/functions for this project:
Read in file 
Priority queue( find or create)
Simulation time loop
Print in format fashion
Contents of the queue 
Dayâ€™s flight

Plans for iteration 1:

	For iteration 1 I plan to  program the reading in the  of a file. The input format is going to cvs. The next function
	is going be called print queue which shall hold the items from the file that will be used in a different function
	and also printout the queue at each time.The next function simulate airport will Simulate an actual airport ,
	so adding/removing planes based on request time. (this will be the priority queue). I plan to not to have the
	priority queue part for it for this iteration. The last part I plan to have is actually having the printout for
	all flights.

Plans for iteration 2:

   My plans for this iteration are to have the priority queue implemented in some sort of way. I created my own priority
   queue within the airport simulation function.
